8.what is k8s
ans. Kubernetes (often abbreviated as "K8s") is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

9. what is aws
ans. AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a cloud computing platform provided by Amazon that offers a wide range of cloud-based services, including compute, storage, databases, analytics, machine learning, and more. It enables organizations to build, deploy, and manage applications and services in the cloud, using a flexible and scalable infrastructure.

10. what is s3
ans. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): A highly scalable object storage service that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.

11.what is ec2
ans. Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): A web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud, making it easy to scale applications and workloads up or down based on demand.

12.what is vpc
ans.  VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a service that enables users to create a logically isolated network in the cloud. VPC provides a secure and flexible way to deploy and manage virtual machines, containers, and other resources within a private and isolated network.

13.what is iam
ans.  IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a service that enables users to manage access to AWS resources securely. IAM provides a centralized way to control access to AWS resources, including services and APIs, by defining permissions and policies for individual users and groups.

14.what is SNS
ans. SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a fully managed messaging service that enables users to send and receive messages between distributed systems and microservices, mobile devices, and other endpoints.

15.what is autoscaling
ans. Auto Scaling is a service that enables users to automatically adjust the capacity of their EC2 instances based on demand. Auto Scaling ensures that the number of EC2 instances running is always proportional to the demand, allowing users to scale their applications seamlessly and efficiently.

16. what is ALB
ans. ALB (Application Load Balancer) is a service that enables users to distribute incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, based on application-level routing rules.

17.what is git
ans. Git is a version control system used for tracking changes in computer files. It is generally used for source code management in software development. Git is used to tracking changes in the source code. The distributed version control tool is used for source code management.

18.what is github
ans. GitHub is a code hosting platform for collaboration and version control. GitHub lets you (and others) work together on projects.

19.what is linux
ans. Linux® is an open source operating system (OS). An operating system is the software that directly manages a system's hardware and resources, like CPU, memory, and storage.

20. what is cloudwatch
ans. Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and management service that provides data and actionable insights for AWS, hybrid, and on-premises applications and infrastructure resources.

21.what is sonarqube
ans. SonarQube is an open-source platform developed by SonarSource for continuous inspection of code quality to perform automatic reviews with static analysis of code to detect bugs and code smells on 29 programming languages

22. what is nexus
ans. Nexus Repository OSS is an open source repository that supports many artifact formats, including Docker, Java™, and npm. 

23.what is bitbucket
ans. BitBucket is a cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control the changes to their code

24. what is RDS
Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service): A web service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud

25. what is CICD CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (or Continuous Delivery)
ans.Continuous Integration (CI) is the process of frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository and automatically building and testing the code to catch errors and conflicts early on. CI helps to ensure that the code is always in a releasable state and reduces the risk of introducing errors into the codebase.

Continuous Deployment (CD) is the process of automatically deploying code changes to production as soon as they are ready. CD helps to reduce the time between code changes and their deployment to production, enabling faster feedback and iteration.

Continuous Delivery (CD) is a software development practice that involves automatically building, testing, and deploying code changes to production as soon as they are ready, without human intervention.
